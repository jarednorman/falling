# Falling [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/porkchopclub/porkchop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/porkchopclub/porkchop)

Nothing to see here. Just some exploratory programming.

## Installation

Install it like any other gem.

    $ gem install falling

## Usage

To start a new game.

    $ falling start_game

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
